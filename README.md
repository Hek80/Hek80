Hey there! I'm Hek80, also known as Zoe.

I've worked previously as a full-stack developer for a large financial institution and more recently started dabbling in game development. Github looks pretty empty because my professional work was all proprietary and managed through private repos so I can't use it as examples here. I'm currently working on fresh projects to upload here so it doesn't look so empty!

I started my programming journey when I was in middle school, back when the newest version of HTML was still 4.01. I learned the basics of web development back then but trying to learn javascript using a textbook and notepad on Windows XP was not a great experience for a 10yo, and so I didn't pick it up again until I was an adult. I started learning C# casually in my own time before being picked up by Revature LLC as part of their talent sourcing program, and was put through an INTENSE bootcamp that ended with a 50% attrition rate and a 33% placement rate from those of us who passed. I took my skills in Java, TypeScript, React and AWS and served as a junior full-stack dev for JP Morgan Chase on what was originally a year-long contract, before budgetary decisions in the company resulted in a workforce reduction that included myself and some of my fellow contractors. I've been studying other technologies like Python and Angular on my own time while working various non-programming jobs and hunting for my next professional opportunity. Feel free to reach out!
